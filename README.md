### Hi, I'm Renato Schiavinato Lopez 👋

I am an **Enterprise Agile Coach** and **Transformation Leader** with over 20 years of experience managing high-stakes programs for global organizations like McDonald's, Santander, and Itaú Unibanco.

I specialize in **governance, human factors, and process safety**. My move into open-source cryptography is driven by a desire to bring **enterprise-grade rigor** to personal digital sovereignty.

### 🛡️ Founder of GRIFORTIS

I founded **GRIFORTIS** to solve the "inheritance problem" in digital assets. We build systems that empower individuals through clear, safe, and auditable processes—prioritizing human execution over blind trust in hardware.

**Current Focus:**
- 🔐 **[Schiavinato Sharing](https://github.com/renatoslopes/Schiavinato_Sharing)**: A human-executable secret sharing scheme for BIP39 mnemonics. It brings mathematical security to pencil-and-paper recovery, designed for long-term inheritance and disaster resilience.

### 🚀 Background & Philosophy

My work sits at the intersection of **technology** and **human behavior**.

- **Agile Leadership**: SAFe 6 RTE/LPM, PSM II, PMP.
- **Transformation**: Leading Agile Centers of Excellence (CoE) and global organizational change.
- **Core Belief**: *"Specialists advise, but users execute."* Security tools should not be black boxes; they should be transparent processes that users can verify and master.

#### ⚡ Fun fact:

My journey into this space began not with code, but with a deep dive into the human factors of security. How good people make critical mistakes under stress, and how we can design better, more forgiving systems to protect them. Also, I'm using my in-laws as guinea pigs. LOL
