### Hi, I'm Renato Schiavinato Lopez 👋

I'm a developer and security researcher from Brazil, focused on building humane, open-source tools for self-sovereignty and digital inheritance.

My primary mission is to solve the complex challenges of long-term value protection, making best-in-class security accessible and manageable for everyone, from individual hodlers to families planning for the next generation.

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on:

*   **[GRIFORTIS](https://github.com/GRIFORTIS)**: The home of all my open-source security projects.
*   **The Schiavinato Cipher**: An experimental, pen-and-paper friendly Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme designed for ultimate disaster recovery.
*   **GRIFORTIS Guardian**: A mainstream, humane tool for creating and recovering industry-standard SLIP39 and SSKR backups.

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning more about:

*   Applied cryptography and secure development practices.
*   The internals of DIY hardware signing devices like SeedSigner.
*   Building ethical and sustainable business models around Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

#### 📫 How to reach me:

*   **For professional inquiries and consulting:** [renato.lopez@grifortis.com](mailto:renato.lopez@grifortis.com)
*   **For project contributions and technical discussions:** Please open an issue in the relevant [GRIFORTIS repository](https://github.com/GRIFORTIS).

#### ⚡ Fun fact:

My journey into this space began not with code, but with a deep dive into the human factors of security. How good people make critical mistakes under stress, and how we can design better, more forgiving systems to protect them. Also, I'm using my in-laws as guinea pigs. LOL
